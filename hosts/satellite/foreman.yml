# How do I Include/Exclude Hosts from Getting Imported to Ansible Tower When Using Satellite 6 Inventory
# https://access.redhat.com/solutions/2777811
# The `host_filters` requires a string constructed exactly the same way you formulate searches in Satellite itself
# So navigate to Satellite and go to where you search for hosts - there's a field to allow searching using regex/tags/etc
# https://satallite.example.com/hosts?search=host_collection+~+monthly-patch-%2A-soa-grp-%2A&page=1
# Once that search works, copy that text and use it here in the `host_filters` parameter.

# Example of a filter specification
#host_filters: 'host_collection = "monthly-patch-dev-soa-grp-1"'
# Example of using wild-card filtering
host_filters: 'host_collection ~ monthly-patch-*-soa-grp-*'
