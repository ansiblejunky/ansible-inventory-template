# Microsoft Excel

There can be times when we need to import data from an Excel spreadsheet. This happens when the spreadsheet is generated from some complex or manual efforts to bring data into a specific format. The `ansible_xlsx_inventory` inventory script supports reading Excel spreadsheets and loads the data into Ansible Tower formatted inventory structures. The documentation is found in the README [here](https://github.com/ansiblejunky/ansible_xlsx_inventory).
